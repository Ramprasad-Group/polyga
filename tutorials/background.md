## Background 
In this background I will explain two things: how genetic algorithms (GAs) work 
and how polyga is implemented. I feel you should understand some of the basics 
behind GAs first so you understand why people use them, and then I can explain 
how polyga is implemented and why it is implemented in this way.

If you already know a lot about GAs and only care about how polyga is 
implemented, see [polyga](#polyga).

### Genetic Algorithms
To start, all genetic algorithms work based off the circle of life.

### (#polyga)

In order to facilitate usage as a general algorithm as opposed to one 
specialized for polymers, it requires a small amount of work on your part. 
However, if you're like me, you really enjoy programming, so I think this will
be fun!
