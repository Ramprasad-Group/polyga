## Background 
In this background I will explain two things: how genetic algorithms (GAs) work 
and how polyga is implemented. I feel you should understand some of the basics 
behind GAs first so you understand why people use them, and then I can explain 
how polyga is implemented and why it is implemented in this way.

To start, all genetic algorithms work based off the circle of life.


In order to facilitate usage as a general algorithm as opposed to one 
specialized for polymers, it requires a small amount of work on your part. 
However, if you're like me, you really enjoy programming, so I think this will
be fun!
