## Analyzing polyga run
After running polyga, we want to analyze the polymers (or other materials)
we have created. To start, let's run the 'analyze\_silly\_test.py' script in 
the silly\_test folder by running the command  
`python analyze_silly_test.py`  
in the terminal
(to see how your directory should look, see the [previous tutorial](basic.md)).

First, the follwing data should print to the terminal.

```
planetary_id
parent_1_id
parent_2_id
is_parent
num_chromosomes
smiles_string
birth_land
birth_nation
birth_planet
str_chromosome_ids
generation
settled_planet
settled_land
settled_nation
Polymer_Coolness
Polymer_Intelligence
Polymer_Funnyness
```

If we open the Silly\_Test folder we should see some images as well. The first
one should look something like this, although, GAs are stochastic models so
your results may vary.  
![properties image](../../imgs/UnitedPolymersOfCool_property_avgs.png)

In this image, the darkred line is the average property value per polymer at
each generation, the light blue is the average +/- the standard deviation, and
the dark blue is the min to max property value of polymers in each generation.
The generations are plotted on a log scale and we see that average values
increase per generation.

This indicates that, like in real life, each generation of polymers is getting 
progressively cooler, funnier, and smarter. However, the next image will offset
this excitement.

![pol length img](../../imgs/length_avg.png)

Here we see the polymer repeat units are getting longer as time goes by. If we 
actually wanted to synthesize these polymers, this increase in length would make 
that much more challenging. To understand why this is occuring, we'll have
to examine our random forest models and fingerprints in a bit, but first, let's
go over the code that facilitated this analysis.

```Python
import os
import sqlite3

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import polyga.analysis as pga
save_loc = 'Planet_Silly'
df, fp_df = pga.load_planet(save_loc)

for col in df.columns:
    print(col)


def plot_average_lengths(df):
    """Plots average lengths of polymers vs generation for all settled_nations"""
    gens = max(df.generation) + 1
    x = np.linspace(0, gens, gens)
    settled_nations = np.unique(df.settled_nation.values)
    legend = []
    for settled_nation in settled_nations:
        tdf = df.loc[df['settled_nation'] == settled_nation]
        means = []
        for gen in range(gens):
            tdf_ = tdf.loc[tdf['generation'] == gen]
            mean = tdf_.num_chromosomes.mean()
            means.append(mean)
        plt.plot(x, means)
        legend.append(settled_nation)
    plt.ylabel('Number of Blocks')
    plt.xlabel('Generation')
    plt.legend(legend, title='avg_num_blocks_per_polymer')
    plt.savefig(save_loc + '/length_avg.png')
    plt.clf()

def plot_property_averages(df):
    """Plots property averages for all settled_nations and displays them separately."""
    properties = ['Polymer_Coolness', 'Polymer_Funnyness','Polymer_Intelligence']
    settled_nations = np.unique(df.settled_nation.values)
    for settled_nation in settled_nations:
        means = []
        maxes = []
        mins = []
        stds = []
        tdf = df.loc[df.settled_nation == settled_nation]
        for prop in properties:
            mean = []
            std = []
            max_ = []
            min_ = []
            for i in range(max(tdf.generation) + 1):
                tdf_ = tdf.loc[tdf['generation'] == i]
                mean.append(tdf_[prop].mean())
                std.append(tdf_[prop].std())
                max_.append(max(tdf_[prop]))
                min_.append(min(tdf_[prop]))
            means.append(mean)
            stds.append(std)
            maxes.append(max_)
            mins.append(min_)

        fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=[16,9])
        x = np.linspace(0, max(tdf.generation), max(tdf.generation)+1)
        x = [val + 1 for val in x]
        row = 0
        col = 0
        curr = 0
        for prop in properties:
            max_ = maxes[curr]
            min_ = mins[curr]
            mean = means[curr]
            std = stds[curr]
            upper = [mean[i] + std[i] for i in range(len(mean))]
            lower = [mean[i] - std[i] for i in range(len(mean))]
            axes[row][col].fill_between(x, min_, max_, alpha=0.5, 
                color='darkblue'
            )
            axes[row][col].fill_between(x, lower, upper, alpha=0.5, 
                color='lightblue'
            )
            axes[row][col].plot(x, means[curr], lw=2, c='darkred')
            axes[row][col].set_ylabel(prop)
            axes[row][col].set_xlim([1,max(tdf.generation)+1])
            axes[row][col].set_xscale("log")
            curr += 1
            col += 1
            if col > 1:
                col = 0
                row += 1
        fig.delaxes(axes[1][1])
        fig.suptitle(settled_nation)
        plt.savefig(save_loc + '/' + settled_nation + '_property_avgs.png')
        plt.clf()

plot_property_averages(df)
plot_average_lengths(df)
```

I won't go into as much detail since a lot of the material is related to 
plotting with matplotlib, but I will discuss a few key points.

First, this section:
```Python
save_loc = 'Planet_Silly'
df, fp_df = pga.load_planet(save_loc)
```

The first thing we're doing is opening our database and extracting our polymers
into df and their fingerprints into fp\_df. In fp\_df, the index 
corresponding to the planetary\_id in df.


After loading the dataframes we run:
```Python
for col in df.columns:
    print(col)
```

Which printed that list to the terminal previously. These are the column
headers that will be generated each time the GA runs, with the exception of the
property columns. These will depend on the properties you are using.

The rest of the code should be relatively self explanatory, so I'll leave
that for you to read. There are a lot of analyses you could run on your results
including uniform manifold approximation and projection maps, an analysis of
chemical composition vs generation, frequency of blocks, etc... 
so I did not include all possible analyses here.

For now, let's go more in depth into 
[how we predicted the polymer properties](predict.md).
